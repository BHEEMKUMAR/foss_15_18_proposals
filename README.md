This is a Repository to invite your ideas and proposals. 

#### Process

The proposals need to follow the following structure:
<ol type="a">
<li> a project title/description </li> 
<li> more detailed description of the project (2-5 sentences) (phases in which work would be done) </li>
<li> expected outcomes </li> 
<li> skills required/preferred </li>  
<li> team members and their respective handles.</li>
<br>

To submit an idea, do so by the following steps:

    Fork this repo
    Create your own <file_name>.md file and name it appropriately with your idea (example: my_awesome_idea.md) using the above structure
    Submit your pull request back to this repo

We will review the submission and if we feel it needs polishing we will respond accordingly. All ideas will be added to the repo.
